**SociaLite** is a project developed for the CS2103T Software Engineering module by [our team](docs/AboutUs.md), based off [AddressBook Level 3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3). It is a desktop app for **connecting you with your contacts’ social media pages**, optimized for use via a command line interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a graphical user interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SociaLite can get you to your contacts’ social media pages faster than traditional GUI apps!
